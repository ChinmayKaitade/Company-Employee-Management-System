# 🏢 Company Employee Management System (SQL Project)

A beginner-friendly SQL-based project to manage employees and departments using MySQL. This system includes database creation, relational table setup with **primary & foreign keys**, CRUD operations, aggregate functions, and **JOIN queries** to simulate a real-world employee management system.

---

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Create & use company database
- ✅ Relational table setup (`Employee`, `Department`)
- ✅ Primary and foreign key constraints
- ✅ CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ Aggregate functions: `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- ✅ `JOIN` queries to fetch employee and department info together
